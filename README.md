Ok.. This little monsta', with the help of python, should take 2 images (equal size pls), one text and one number from the user in a fancy way.
Done this, he calls to his more big brotha', who knows nothing but java, who runs 4 threads in a inefficient.
Finally IT comes with 3 heads on her neck.. first head, called index.html aka tooManyCells, the second one is Normalize.css, seems as pretty as not useful,
and the last one is the script.js you just wrote waay before.

Sorry for that, have fun!
